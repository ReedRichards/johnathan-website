						    <h3>Owners and Founders<br> Johnathan Hausmann and Shelby Stoughton</h3>
						    <p>We believe your home, office or business is a reflection of you and that your floor can create a positive first impression when people walk in your door. Our goal at WPC is to provide you with that statement floor that gives you a “wow” factor. We have chosen to work in the communities we live so our reputation is very important to us.  Our business model is based on personal references which means your satisfaction is the most important aspect of our job.  We have satisfied customers because we insure our product meets your needs first and foremost.  Educated clients are happy so we take the time to evaluate your needs in person, survey the area where flooring will be done, discuss what your vision is and develop a comprehensive plan based on these factors.  We both have strong ethical backgrounds that we take pride in.  We were raised with the expectations of honesty, attention to detail, and doing things correctly the first time. These core values are how we operate our business today.  Communication, transparency in pricing and service insure your peace of mind and that you will not only like your new floor and your experience with WPC, you will love it! </p>
